Booster: the Toboot Updater
===========================

Toboot cannot update itself, because a partial flash would result in an unbootable system.

`Booster` is used to guide the installation of Toboot.  By appending a new version of Toboot to the end of Booster, we can create a program to update Toboot itself.
